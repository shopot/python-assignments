  - 🚀[Assignment: Python basics](tasks/01-python-basics/assignment.md)
  - 🚩[Scoring: Python basics](tasks/01-python-basics/score.md)
  - 📚 [Learning materials](tasks/01-python-basics/materials.md)

## How to complete the tasks

1. Create a repository (unless explicitly stated that it should be based on a previously created repository).
2. Create a branch (E.g. `develop`) for the task solution from the `main` branch (or from the development branch with the solution to the previous task if it hasn't been assessed yet), giving it a relevant name.
3. Work on the task in this branch, do not push the final solution to the remote repository (development is done locally).
4. Push the solution to the branch.
5. Create a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch but do not merge it yet.
6. After the assessment is completed and you receive a grade, merge the PR into the `main` branch.

**Steps 1-6 are repeated for each new task.**
