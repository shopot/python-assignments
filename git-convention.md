# Git convention

## Commit Requirements

- The names of the commits should be according to the guideline - [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)
- The commit type MUST BE in lowercase only (init, feat, fix, refactor, docs etc.)
- Present tense ("add feature" not "added feature") should be used.
- Imperative mood ("move cursor to ..." not "moves cursor to ..." should be used).

## Examples of commit names

- **init**: - used to start the project / task. Example:
  ```code
  init: start youtube-task
  init: start mentor-dashboard task
  ```
- **feat**: - this is the implemented new functionality from the technical specifications (added zoom support, added footer, added product card). Example:

  ```code
  feat: add basic page layout
  feat: implement search box
  feat: implement request to youtube API
  feat: implement swipe for horizontal list
  feat: add additional navigation button
  feat: add banner
  feat: add social links
  feat: add physical security section
  feat: add real social icons
  ```

- **fix**: - fixed a bug in previously implemented functionality. Example:
  ```code
  fix: implement correct loading data from youtube
  fix: change layout for video items to fix bugs
  fix: relayout header for firefox
  fix: adjust social links for mobile
  ```
- **refactor**: - did not add new functionality / behavior did not change. Files in other places put, deleted, added. Changed the code formatting (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc). Improved the algorithm, without changing the functionality. Example:
  ```code
  refactor: change structure of the project
  refactor: rename vars for better readability
  refactor: apply eslint
  refactor: apply prettier
  ```
- **docs**: - used when working with project documentation / readme. Example:
  ```code
  docs: update readme with additional information
  docs: update description of run() method
  ```
